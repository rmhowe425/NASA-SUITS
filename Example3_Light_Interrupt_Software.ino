/*
  This example code will walk you through how to set the interrupts on the
  SparkFun VEML6030 Ambient Light Sensor. You can set both high and low
  thresholds as well as how many values must be below or above the threshold
  before an interrupt occurs. This example does not require the interrupt pin on
  the product to be connected a pin on your micro-controller.
